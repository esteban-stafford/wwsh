SUMMARY:
    The ipmi command is used for setting node ipmi configuration attributes.

COMMANDS:

         set             Modify an existing node configuration
         list            List a summary of the node(s) ipmi configuration
         print           Print the full node(s) ipmi configuration
         poweron         Power on the list of nodes
         poweroff        Power off the list of nodes
         powercycle      Power cycle the list of nodes
         powerstatus     Print the power status of the nodes
         ident           Set chassis identify light to on for the nodes
         noident         Set chassis identify light to off for the nodes
         printsel        Print system event log for the nodes
         clearsel        Clear system event log for the nodes
         printsdr        Print sensor data records for the nodes
         console         Start a serial-over-lan console session.
                         NOTE: Requires that a serial console be defined
                         in kernel arguments, i.e. console=ttyS0,57600

         forcepxe        Force next boot from PXE
         forcedisk       Force next boot from first Hard Drive
         forcecdrom      Force next boot from CD-ROM
         forcebios       Force next boot into BIOS

         help            Show usage information

TARGETS:

     The target is the specification for the node you wish to act on. All targets
     can be bracket expanded as follows:

         n00[0-99]       inclusively all nodes from n0000 to n0099
         n00[00,10-99]   n0000 and inclusively all nodes from n0010 to n0099

OPTIONS:

     -l, --lookup        How should we reference this node? (default is name)
         --ipaddr        The IPMI accessible IP address for this node. If multiple
                         nodes are given, this IP address will be incremented for
                         each node given
         --netmask       The netmask defined for this node
         --uid           The IPMI ID to use for the user on this node
         --username      Define the IPMI username for this node
         --password      Define the IPMI password for this node
         --proto         Define the IPMI protocol for this node (defaults to lan)
         --autoconfig    Automatically try and configure this node's IPMI settings
                         on boot (boolean 1/0) - note: if no password is set for the
                         node, one will be randomly generated
     -d, --delay         Delay/pad the IPMI commands (very useful for throttling boots)
     -f, --fanout        Change the fanout for parallel IPMI commands (default: 8)

EXAMPLES:

     Warewulf> ipmi set n000[0-4] --ipaddr=10.100.0.1 --netmask=255.255.255.0
